## [Unreleased][github/self/unreleased] <a name="unreleased"></a>

### Added <a name="unreleased/added"></a>

- Implement `zero()` for `geo::Coordinate`.
- Implement __multi-dimensional metrics__, being comparable according to __pareto-optimality__.


### Changed <a name="unreleased/changed"></a>

- Implement clean ordering- and equal-traits for `CostNode`s in the routing-modules.


### Deprecated <a name="unreleased/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..
- The graphbuilder uses __Array-of-Structs__ via `ProtoEdge`s to store the proto-info.
  When finalizing the parsed graph, the metrics are copied to the graph.
  This leads to a memory-usage, which is dependent of the number of metrics.
  That's because all metrics have to be processed in one loop and they are not dropped until the loop has finished.
  This could be fixed by storing the metrics as __Struct-of-Arrays__ and finalizing metrics in several loop-runs with immediate drops.

## [v0.8.0][github/self/v0.8.0] <a name="v0.8.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.8.0/added"></a>

- Add wiki-content to cargo-documentation and extend `README.md`
- Add file `notes.md` for information, which
  - is not needed anywhere else.
  - is future-documentation.
  - is a future-issue.
- Stop ignoring `Cargo.lock` in `.gitignore`.
- Add __playground-example__ for generating __random numbers__.
- Extend __routing__
  - Implement a bidirectional Astar.
  - Implement a real Dijkstra without estimation-function, meaning explicitly instead of implicitly having the estimation-function returning zero.
  - Extend __routing-factory__ accordingly.
  - __Benchmarks__ for routing-algorithms, added to github-actions as new job uploading results as __artifacts__.
  - Add __new testing-map with respective tests__ especially designed for __baiting__ bidirectional Astar.
    It has paths between some nodes, whose best path wrt smallest weight is not the best path wrt hop-distance.
  - Add random-route-pairs to __astar-example__ basing on random numbers generated by a seeded uniformly distribution.
- Add trait `Display` as dependency for trait `Metric`.


### Changed <a name="v0.8.0/changed"></a>

- Change graph-building
  - __Reduce additional memory-usage__ when building graph.
    Now, when data is not used anymore, but already stored in the graph, it is dropped.
  - Remove `way-id` from the graphbuilder since it is not used anyways.
  - Let parser already deliver metrics instead of primitives.
- Extract the github-action-step `deploy-and-tag` as separate job.
- Change routing
  - Refactor complete module to improve code-structure of new modules (-> see section [`Added`](#v0.8.0/added)).
  - Make `paths`-module more __public__.
    Still keep access to underlying implementation-struct (`VecPath` or `HashPath`) __private__ to be flexible over changes.
  - Merge some __test__-modules to __reduce folder-complexity and redundant code__.
- Rename some methods more explicetly, like `geo::Coordinate::from -> geo::Coordinate::from_64`.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.8.0/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..
- `CostNode`s in the routing-modules are implementing ordering- and equal-traits sloppy.


### Fixed <a name="v0.8.0/fixed"></a>

- In `CHANGELOG.md`, markdown-links (not URLs!) in the table-of-contents should be persistent, meaning `#v1.0.0-yanked` should be `#v1.0.0`.
- In example `astar`, the distance has been printed with two units (`123 m m`).
- Add an alternative best route to a test-case of the small graph, that has been missing.


## [v0.7.1][github/self/v0.7.1] <a name="v0.7.1"></a>

### Changed

- Fix link to `docs.rs` in `README.md`


### Deprecated

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- Routing should be extended by a `bidirectional Astar`.
- The link to `doc.rs` is hardcoded to `major.minor.patch=0.y.z` because `docs.rs` chooses version `1.0.0` though it's yanked..
- Building the graph uses too much additional memory due to not dropping unused data though it is already stored in the graph.


## [v0.7.0][github/self/v0.7.0] <a name="v0.7.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v0.7.0/added"></a>

- Implement __access to forward-edges and backward-edges__, as preparation to the `bidirectional Dijkstra`, .
  - Process queries for forward-edges and backward-edges by the same code, due to the new pattern with the __shallow containers__.
    To achieve this without additional performance-cost, use a index-mapping for offsets, while accessing all other components (node-indices and metrics) directly.
  - Extend graph-construction-tests for backward-edges.
- Add __documentation__ for the graph.
- Add a __metric-system__ replacing primitive data-types.
  - Support typical calculations as `v = s/t`, typed correctly (`meters / milliseconds -> km/h`).


### Changed <a name="v0.7.0/changed"></a>

- Comment in `Cargo.toml`, over changing the version, to not forget changing the `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Refactor the graph by a new pattern.
  - Add new examples playing around with different patterns (`RefCell` vs `moving` vs `borrowing`).
  - Store the data in arrays in one single struct (the graph), while granting access over layer-structs borrowing these arrays and executing user-queries.
    This makes maintainability without breaking changes easier.
  - Let the graph-interface allow access via `NodeContainer` and `EdgeContainer`.
- Replace the use of usize by new structs, `NodeIdx` and `EdgeIdx`, to control the access to graph-components.
- Refactor logging slightly by adding progress-bars to parsing and building.
- Use a new type-parameter in the `Astar` for a metric-type, which are added in this release.
  - Change the access to best-path-algorithms slightly.


### Deprecated <a name="v0.7.0/deprecated"></a>

- Documentation is missing, though comments are very well.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
  - Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Inconsistent `semver` in old tags -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- Routing should be extended by a `bidirectional Astar`.


### Removed <a name="v0.7.0/removed"></a>

- The feature showing whether an `edge is enabled` is being removed to make handling backward-edges easier.
- `Edge-ID`s are not needed and hence removed.
- When building and finalizing the graph, `ProtoNode`s and `ProtoEdge`s don't need ordering implemented, hence these implementations are removed.


## [v1.0.0-yanked][github/self/v1.0.0-yanked] <a name="v1.0.0"></a>

### Added <a name="v1.0.0/added"></a>

- Add `CHANGELOG.md`. `:)`
- Add GitHub-action automatically testing and deploying.
  As improvement over travis-ci, it tags commits automatically if the `Cargo.toml`-version has changed and pushed.
  Before, both (tag and `Cargo.toml`) had to be updated.


### Changed <a name="v1.0.0/changed"></a>

- The `README.md` has no longer `News` due to the new `CHANGELOG.md`.


### Deprecated <a name="v1.0.0/deprecated></a>

- `CHANGELOG.md` contains empty version-descriptions.
- Replace existing tags with ones referring to `CHANGELOG.md` and add old tag-texts to the `CHANGELOG.md`
- Inconsistent `semver` in tagging -> probably `cargo yank VERSION` needed
- The `graph`-interface should allow access via `node`- and `edge`-containers
  - This would improve maintainability and reduce number of breaking changes in the future.
  - Further, it would allow using multidimensional metrics easier an probably improves caching thanks to `Structure of Arrays` instead of currently used `Array of Structures`
- The `graph` containing forward-edges will be extended by backward-edges.
  - The feature showing whether an `edge is enabled` will be removed.
- Routing should be extended by a `bidirectional Astar`.


### Removed <a name="v1.0.0/removed></a>

- The `braess-optimization` has been removed (to a `kutgw`-branch), since it's just kind of a big playground and interferes with future code, at least when testing.
- `Travis-CI` has been replaced by `GitHub`-workflows (-> see section [`Added`](#v1.0.0/added)).
