Purpose

The repository 'osmgraphing' parses maps of own format or maps from openstreetmap.
To do this, a binary 'osmgraphing' is built and an own-defined config-file can be provided to specify parser- and routing-settings.
Besides that, a binary 'mapgenerator' is built and can be used to generate map-files.
